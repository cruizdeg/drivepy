High level python wrappers for drivers of some scientific laboratory instruments used during the course of my PhD at the University of Tokyo from 2012-2016.

There are classes for the following instruments:
* Thor Labs and Melles-Griot APT Stepper Motor and Piezoelectric actuator controllers
* Thor Labs FW102c stepper motor controlled filter wheel
* Agilent Power Meter 8163A/B
* Newport Power Meter 1928-C
* Advantest Optical Spectrum Analyzer Q8384
* Anritsu MS2668C Electrical Spectrum Analyzer

I hope that someone will find these useful and will also contribute their own drivers to make life as easy as possible for
other scientists/engineers who want to use Python for instrument control as a viable alternative to Labview and Matlab.

The drivers were developed and tested on a Windows x86 environment with the Enthought Canopy Python 2.7 distribution. Your mileage may vary on other development environments. The package is released under the GPL license with no warranty, please see the license file.

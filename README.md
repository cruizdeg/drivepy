High level python wrappers for drivers of some scientific laboratory instruments used during the course of my PhD at the University of Tokyo from 2012-2016.

There are classes for the following instruments:
* Thor Labs and Melles-Griot APT Stepper Motor and Piezoelectric actuator controllers
* Thor Labs FW102c stepper motor controlled filter wheel
* Agilent Power Meter 8163A/B
* Newport Power Meter 1928-C
* Advantest Optical Spectrum Analyzer Q8384
* Anritsu MS2668C Electrical Spectrum Analyzer

I hope that someone will find these useful and will also contribute their own drivers to make life as easy as possible for
other scientists/engineers who want to use Python for instrument control as a viable alternative to Labview and Matlab.

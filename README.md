High level python wrappers for drivers of scientific laboratory instruments.

So far there are classes for the following instruments:
* Thor Labs and Melles-Griot APT Stepper Motor and Piezoelectric actuator controllers
* Thor Labs FW102c stepper motor controlled filter wheel
* Newport Power Meter 1928-C
* Advantest Optical Spectrum Analyzer Q8384
* Anritsu MS2668C Electrical Spectrum Analyzer

I will add support for more instruments when I use them in my research. 
Also, I hope that anyone who finds these useful will also contribute 
their own drivers to this (or another) project, to make life as easy as possible for
other scientists/engineers who want to use Python for instrument control
as a viable alternative to Labview and Matlab.

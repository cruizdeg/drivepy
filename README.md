High level python drivers for scientific laboratory instruments.

So far there are classes for the following instruments:
Thor Labs and Melles-Griot APT Piezoelectric controllers
Newport Power Meter 1928-C
Advantest Optical Spectrum Analyzer Q8384

I will add support for more instruments when I use them in my research. 
Also, I hope that anyone who finds these useful will also contribute 
their own drivers to this (or another) project, to make life as easy as possible for
other scientists/engineers who want to use Python for instrument control
as a viable alternative to Labview and Matlab.
